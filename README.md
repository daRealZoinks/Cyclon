# Cyclon

Cyclon is an open-source, in progress programming language written in C++ that I'm designing for fun and learning. It is a statically typed, compiled language with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The language is designed to be easy to read and write, with a syntax that is similar to Python and JavaScript.

Being a work in progress, Cyclon is not yet fully functional and is still in the early stages of development. However, I am actively working on it and plan to add features and functionality in the future.

## Features

- Variable declarations
- Arithmetic operations
- String operations
- Boolean operations
- Control flow statements (if, else, while)
- Functions
- And more...
